# ZeroMQ with NetMQ Examples

This repository contains examples of communication pattern implementations using ZeroMQ with NetMQ in the context of .NET development.

## About NetMQ

NetMQ is a port of ZeroMQ for the .NET platform. It provides a powerful messaging library that enables efficient asynchronous communication between distributed processes.

### NetMQ Features:
- **Lightweight and Performant:** Enjoy the efficiency of ZeroMQ in the .NET ecosystem.
- **Flexible Message Patterns:** Utilize patterns such as PUB-SUB, REQ-REP, PUSH-PULL, and more.
- **Ease of Integration:** NetMQ is designed for easy integration into .NET projects.

## Repository Structure

Each communication pattern is implemented in a separate project within this solution. See below for the available projects:

- `zeromq-netmq-examples.PubSub`: Example implementation of the PUB-SUB pattern.
- `zeromq-netmq-examples.ReqRep`: Example implementation of the REQ-REP pattern.
- `zeromq-netmq-examples.PushPull`: Example implementation of the PUSH-PULL pattern.

## How to Run the Examples

To run any example, follow the instructions provided in the README of the specific project you are interested in.
